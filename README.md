# opx-db-sql
This repository contains a wrapper to the db-sql API which is used for a virtual machine (VM) target.

A VM presents an abstraction of the hardware (thermal sensors, fans, LEDs, optics, interfaces, and so on) in a VM environment. SDI VM's sole client is PAS, similarly the SAI VM client is NAS and it queries the devices using the API defined in the sdi-api and functionality in the sai-api.
